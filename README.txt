This is a script for a easy camera calibration,

to do it first create a folder "camera_calib" and a subfolder "chessboard" inside of it

then run the command:
	python3 image_capture.py

Now you want to capture image of the chessboard in many different position (around 55 images)

Once done, stop the script (esc) and run : 
	python3 camera_calib.py
	
tadaaaa, simple as that
